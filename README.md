# Stock Screener-Backtester

Stock Screener/Backtester is a Python tool that allows users to create their own stock screener with over 50 different fundamental analysis screening criteria. The tool provides users with the ability to backtest their stock screener's performance and compare it with the market index. The tool is built using Tiingo stock data and allows users to screen and backtest NYSE/NASDAQ stocks, including delisted stocks.

## Features
